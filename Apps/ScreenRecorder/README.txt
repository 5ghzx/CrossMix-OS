Copy all the folders:
ScreencapTK
ScreenRecorder
TwitchStream

To your /mnt/SDCARD/Apps directory

(Just Apps when SD card is in PC)

When launching:

When you click an app, it will seem like nothing has happened however if you have everything in the correct places it will have started ffmpeg

For twitch:

Add your stream key to the launch.sh file where it says YOURKEYHERE

For screen recorder:

The output files must be ended correctly, when you starrt recording you must finish recording by clicking the app again, this will save the file in /mnt/SDCARD/Apps/ScreenRecorder/output.
