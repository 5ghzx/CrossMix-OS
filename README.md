## Some words from the author

I'm Cizia, a passionate retrogamer. I love the TrimUI Smart Pro, but I felt it deserved a more mature OS, better configured, and with more options. I worked tirelessly to create an image that meets my standards, and today, I'm sharing it with you.

In version 1.0.0, there are some features I'm particularly proud of, such as:

- **Background and icon selectors**: it completes well the native theme selector.
- **Overlay selector**: Configure your default display ratio and overlay in one click for all platforms, plus new dedicated overlays.
- **SwanStation 16/9 mode launcher**.
- **Extensive work on emulator launchers and configuration**.
- **Default customization of the OS**: custom theme, icons and backgrounds, Polish language added and many new tools.
- **Firmware Update Wizard**: an automatic guide to help user to update if necessary.

I would also like to extend a warm thank you to Kloptops for [PortMaster and his tools](https://github.com/kloptops/TRIMUI_EX) which are deeply used in CrossMix-OS.

Thanks to Schmurtzm for his numerous scripts, I have revised and integrated them into CrossMix-OS, which have greatly enhanced the available features:
- [PSX Analog Detector](https://github.com/schmurtzm/TrimUI-Smart-Pro/blob/main/SystemTools/Apps/SystemTools/Menu/EMULATORS/PSX%20Analog%20Detector.sh): Detects PSX games compatible with analog sticks and automatically sets the correct controller configuration.
- [BootLogo](https://github.com/schmurtzm/TrimUI-Smart-Pro/tree/main/Bootlogo): An app for easy boot logo flashing on TrimUI Smart Pro.
- [EmuCleaner](https://github.com/schmurtzm/TrimUI-Smart-Pro/tree/main/EmuCleaner): An app to display only emulators with ROMs installed.
- [System Tools](https://github.com/schmurtzm/TrimUI-Smart-Pro/tree/main/SystemTools): An app to centralize different apps/scripts in one place.
- [Resume at Boot](https://github.com/schmurtzm/TrimUI-Smart-Pro/tree/main/ResumeAtBoot): A set of scripts to add a resume game on startup feature.
- [Subfolder config override finder](https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/issues/12021#issuecomment-2107300989) is also used in CrossMix-OS.


I hope CrossMix-OS will become a reference among OSes based on Stock-OS and continue to improve with community support.
